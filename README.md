# TMDb Top 1000 Actors Snapshot (Example: June 15, 2025)

This repository contains:

- A Python script to fetch and generate a CSV dataset of the 1000 most talked-about actors on The Movie Database (TMDb) at the time the script is run.
- An example CSV file representing the snapshot taken on June 15, 2025.

## What This Is

- The CSV includes actor names, profile image URLs, known-for titles, and brief bios.
- The popularity ranking is based on TMDbâ€™s internal metric, reflecting current online attention.
- This is not a curated or definitive list, but a dynamic snapshot based on when you run the script.

## Important Notes

- The example CSV is a snapshot taken on June 15, 2025.
- If you run the script yourself with your own TMDb API key (which is *not* included here), it will generate a snapshot reflecting the actors popular *at the time you run it*.
- TMDb data may include biases or gaps; popularity fluctuates.
- If someone just had a show come out the day before you make the CSV, then their popularity may be inflated. Since shows are always coming out, this will almost certainly mean that a couple relatively obscure actors and actresses will sneak into your data.
- This is a list of the most famous actors GLOBALLY. Hollywood will obviously be overrepresented due to American cultural hegemony, but also expect a fair mix of Bollywood, Korean drama stars, anime voice actors, etc. This is a cosmopolitan snapshot. 

## Usage and Attribution

- This project is for educational and personal use only.
- Actor data and images are sourced from [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) under their [terms of use](https://www.themoviedb.org/terms-of-use).
- Please credit TMDb if you use or distribute this data.

Feel free to fork and adapt the code with your own API key to generate your own snapshots.
